The file `all_stable_bandgap_electronegativities.csv` was created based on the atoms occurring in the walks corpus
`all_stable_bandgap.node2vec.walks`. The electronegativity for an atom was obtained from `electronegativities2.csv`
if a value for that atom exists in the file, otherwise it was obtained from `electronegativities.csv`.
